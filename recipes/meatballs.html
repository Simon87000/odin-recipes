    <h2>How to Bake Meatballs In the Oven</h2>
        <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
        </br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bread crumbs:</strong> Buy Italian-seasoned bread crumbs at the store or make your own at home.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> This recipe calls for Romano cheese, but you can use Parmesan if what you have on hand.</li>
            <li><strong>Parsley:</strong> Fresh parsley adds a welcome pop of color and flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> These baked meatballs are seasoned with salt, black pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Whole eggs lend moisture and help bind the meatballs together so they don't fall apart.</li>
            <li><strong>Beef:</strong> This classic recipe calls for ground beef, but you can use ground turkey if you'd rather.</li>
        </ul>
        </br>
