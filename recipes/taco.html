    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ripe plum tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 small white onion, quartered</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
            <li>4 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 Â½ teaspoons chili powder</li>
        </ul>
        </br>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high. Arrange whole tomatoes, onions (cut-side down), and garlic in the dry skillet in a single layer, working in batches if needed. Cook, turning occasionally, until charred on all sides, about 6 minutes for the garlic and about 12 minutes for the onions and tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Transfer charred vegetables to a blender and add chipotle peppers. Process until smooth, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir salt, chili powder, cumin, and black pepper together in a small bowl; season beef evenly with salt mixture.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add beef in batches and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer browned beef to a large plate.</li>
            <li>Pour water into the Dutch oven and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Stir in onion-tomato mixture, brown sugar, oregano, and bay leaves. Reduce heat to medium-low and bring to a simmer.</li>
        </ol>
