    <h2>What to Serve With Lobster Risotto</h2>
        <p>Risotto is typically served as a side dish. But, since this satisfying dish contains meaty lobster, we think it would work perfectly well as an entree.</p>
        </br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>2 onions, chopped</li>
            <li>6 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 shallot, chopped</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups Arborio rice</li>
        </ul>
        </br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions; cook and stir until caramelized and very tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bring chicken broth to a boil in a pot; reduce heat to low and keep at a simmer.</li>
            <li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large, flat-bottom pan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir shallot and garlic in the hot oil until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add Arborio rice to shallot mixture; cook and stir until rice begins to brown, about 3 minutes. Add wine and cook for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir 1 cup chicken broth into rice mixture; cook, stirring constantly, until broth is absorbed. Repeat adding broth, 1 cup at a time, until all the broth is used, stirring constantly until broth is absorbed each time, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir honey into onions; cook and stir, 5 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Stir butter into rice mixture until melted. Add cream and stir until rice mixture thickens, about 3 minutes. Add paprika and cayenne pepper; stir well. Add sherry and mix well. Stir lobster meat into rice mixture and cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. Mix Parmesan cheese into rice mixture until melted. Add onion mixture and mix well; season with salt and pepper.</li>
        </ol>
    <h2>How to Store Lobster Risotto</h2>
        <p>Store your leftover lobster risotto in a shallow, airtight container for two to three days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stove, adding a splash of broth if you're worried about losing some of the creaminess. We don't recommend freezing risotto, so try to enjoy it within a couple days.</p>
